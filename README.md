# Phil's Escape

A browser-based platformer game built with vanilla HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript — no dependencies, no build step, just open `index.html` and play.

Phil is a warrior from the Stickman Army who's trying to break free. Fight through two worlds packed with enemies, mini-bosses, and world bosses to earn your freedom.

## Roadmap

The current game is a complete v1.0 experience. Here's what's planned:

### Core improvements
- **Checkpoint respawn** — dying respawns Phil at the last blue flag instead of ending the run
- **Save progress** — remember which world/level you've reached between sessions
- **Difficulty modes** — Easy / Normal / Hard with tuned enemy speed, damage, and boss health
- **Pause menu** — Escape key to pause mid-level, with resume / restart / quit options

### More content
- **New worlds** — additional themes beyond Forest and Desert
- **More enemy types** — heavy soldiers, bomb throwers, flying enemies
- **Environmental hazards** — moving saws, lava pits, falling rocks
- **Moving platforms** — horizontal movers, elevators, falling platforms
- **Collectible power-ups** — health refills, invincibility stars, speed boosts, score multipliers
- **Kill combo system** — chain kills quickly for a score multiplier

### Polish & progression
- **World map & level select** — visual overworld with locked/unlocked level nodes
- **Unlockable character skins** — cosmetic rewards for completing worlds and achievements
- **Story cutscenes** — canvas-drawn comic panels at key moments (intro, boss fights, ending)
- **Settings screen** — volume controls and fullscreen toggle

### Creator tools
- **Level maker** — in-browser editor to build and test custom levels
- **Share levels via URL** — encode custom levels into a shareable link (no backend needed)

### Online
- **GitHub Pages deployment** — play in the browser without downloading anything
